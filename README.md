# contrast-logic
This site determines the contrast between multiple colors, lists compatible combinations, and shows a grid of all possible foreground and background color combinations. 
* Supports all CSS color styles, named colors (coral), and CMYK.
* Supports alpha and calculates contrast for alpha mixed over background colors to determine actual contrast ratios.
* Downloading the report as an .html file is also included, as well as a help document that covers common questions and documents how this tool works.
